# Progress tracker app

Very simple app to visually display your progress on whatever it is you want to
accomplish.

Just create a task for whatever it is you want to keep track of, and then the
app will take care of the rest.

## Running the app

Install the requirements in `requirements.txt`, and then run the app with:

```
python main.py
```
