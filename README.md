# Progress tracker app

Very simple app to visually display your progress on whatever it is you want to
accomplish.

Just create a task for whatever it is you want to keep track of, and then the
app will take care of the rest.

Ideal for visualizing your progress, seeing where you have work to do, and
overall bragging to your friends that your bars hit harder than theirs.

## Running the app

Install the requirements in `requirements.txt`, and then run the app with:

```
python main.py
```
